# Kattegat client

This is a Bower module for client-side helper code for the [Kattegat application server](https://github.com/ClintH/kattegat).

If you have [Bower](http://bower.io/) already installed, you can install kattegat-client via:

````
$ bower install kattegat-client
````

(It's installed for you automatically when you generate a Kattegat project)

## Build

If you want to modify the internals of `kattegat-client`, it's necessary to build it afterward with grunt.

To build:

```
$ npm install && grunt
```
